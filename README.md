#### Summary
From this dataset we were able to determine several things. Overall it appears that ENPH is the safest option. RUN is also a safe option. Both of these have a high total daily volume. However, TERP is relativelt small in volume but also not a good option. We can determine from the results that the higher the daily volume the more successful the stocks are. Larger stocks are the better investment.
